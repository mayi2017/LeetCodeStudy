> 多种解法

```sql
编写一个 SQL 查询，获取 Employee 表中第二高的薪水（Salary） 。

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
例如上述 Employee 表，SQL查询应该返回 200 作为第二高的薪水。如果不存在第二高的薪水，那么查询应返回 null。

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+


select (select Salary from Employee group by Salary order by Salary desc limit 1,1) as SecondHighestSalary;

select (select distinct Salary from Employee order by Salary desc limit 1,1) as SecondHighestSalary;

select max(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary from Employee where Salary < (select max(Salary) from Employee);

select max(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary from Employee where Salary != (select max(Salary) from Employee);

select(select a.Salary from Employee a, Employee b where a.Salary < b.Salary order by a.Salary desc limit 1) as SecondHighestSalary;
```
ps：加上子查询的作用是当子句不存在的时候值为null
